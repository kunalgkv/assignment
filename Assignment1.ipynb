    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(i) `var1` is a string.\n",
    "(ii) `var2` is a string.\n",

    "\n",
    "A3. Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) `/` - Division Operator:\n",
    "The `/` operator is used for division. It performs floating-point division, meaning it returns the quotient as a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "result = a / b\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) `%` - Modulo Operator:\n",
    "The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division operation. It can be used to check divisibility or extract digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "result = a % b\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) `//` - Floor Division Operator:\n",
    "The `//` operator performs integer division and returns the largest possible integer quotient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "result = a // b\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) `**` - Exponentiation Operator:\n",
    "The `**` operator is used for exponentiation. It raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "result = a ** b\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",

    "A7. In Python, mutable and immutable are properties of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types:\n",
    "Mutable data types can be modified after they are created. Any changes made to the object will be reflected in its memory location. Examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Types:\n",
    "Immutable data types cannot be modified once they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object. Examples of immutable data types in Python include strings, integers, floats, and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_string = my_string + \" World\"\n",
