    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can comment code using the `#` symbol for single-line comments and using triple quotes `\"\"\" \"\"\"` or `''' '''` for multi-line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a\n",
    "multi-line\n",
    "comment\n",

    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are used to store and manipulate data. They act as placeholders for values that can be accessed and modified throughout the program. To declare and assign values to variables, we uses the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "name = \"Kunal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or constructors. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting a string to an integer\n",
    "num_str = \"10\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num_str)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting an integer to a string\n",
    "num_int = 10\n",
    "num_str = str(num_int)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting a string to a float\n",
    "float_str = \"3.14\"\n",
    "num_float = float(float_str)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting a float to an integer\n",
    "num_float = 3.14\n",
    "num_int = int(num_float)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "To write and execute a Python script from the command line, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a text editor and write your Python code.\n",
    "2. Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `script.py`.\n",
    "3. Open a command prompt or terminal.\n",
    "4. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved using the `cd` command.\n",
    "5. Execute the script using the command `python script.py`, replacing `script.py` with the actual name of your script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Given a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list `[2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use list slicing in Python to obtain a sub-list. In this case, to get the sub-list `[2, 3]` from `my_list`, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sub_list = my_list[1:3]\n",
    "print(sub_list)\n",

    "Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a complex number is a number of the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `j` is the imaginary unit equal to the square root of -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, complex numbers are represented using the `complex` data type. The imaginary part is denoted using the `j` or `J` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "z = 3 + 2j\n",
    "print(z)  # Output: (3+2j)\n",
    "\n",

    "Q7. What is the correct way to declare a variable named `age` and assign the value `25` to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct way to declare a variable named `age` and assign the value `25` to it is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Declare a variable named `price` and assign the value `9.99` to it. What data type does this variable belong to?\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable named `price` and assign the value `9.99` to it, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "price = 9.99\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `price` belongs to the data type `float`, which represents decimal numbers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Create a variable named `name` and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the value of this variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable named `name` and assign your full name to it as a string, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "//replaced your full name to kunal\n",
    "name = \"kunal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the value of the `name` variable, we can use the `print()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output kunal.\n",

    "Q10. Given the string `\"Hello, World!\"`, extract the substring `\"World\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the substring `\"World\"` from the string `\"Hello, World!\"`, we can use string slicing. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "s = \"Hello, Love!\"\n",
    "substring = s[7:]\n",
